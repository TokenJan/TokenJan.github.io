> Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration - whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday - I thought we could mark this November the fifth, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.<br/>

伦敦,晚上好。请允许我先致歉。我跟你们很多人一样欣赏规律生活的舒适，熟悉面孔所带来的安全感，以及日复一日的平静。我跟任何人都一样享受，不过就节日的角度来讲，节日是用美好的假日来庆祝过去的重大事件，通常和某人的死亡或者血腥残酷的斗争的结束有关。我想我们可以从生活中抽出一点时间坐下来聊聊如何纪念今年的11月5日，一个可悲的被遗忘的日子。

> There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?<br/>

当然有些人不希望我们说话，全副武装的人马上就会上路。为什么？尽管沉默代替了谈话，言语却总是保持着他的力量，言语提供了表达见解的方式，而且他可以告诉那些愿意倾听人们真相。而真相是这个国家的有些事情不正常的可怕，对吗?

>Cruelty and injustice...intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told...if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.<br/>

残暴，不公，歧视和镇压，在这快土地上，你们曾经拥有过反对的自由，有过思考和言论的自由，而现在你们拥有的是胁迫你们就范的审查制度和监视系统，这是怎么发生的？这要怪谁？当然有些人要背负比其他人更大的责任，他们会为此付出代价的。不过话说回来，你们如果要找罪人的话，照照镜子就行了。

>I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War. Terror. Disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler. He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.<br/>

我知道你为什么这样做，我知道你害怕，谁不会呢？ 战争，恐怖事件，疾病，曾经有无数的问题企图要摧毁你的理性，剥夺你的常识。恐惧控制了你，你在慌乱中把票投给了元首先生，他许诺给你们秩序，他许诺给你们和平，所要的回报是你的服从和沉默。

>Last night, I sought to end that silence. Last night, I destroyed the Old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom are more than words - they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek...then I ask you to stand beside me, one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament. And together, we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever, be forgot!

 昨晚我决定要结束这种沉默。昨晚我摧毁了老巴里街，以提醒这个国家把他所忘记的事情想起。四百多年前，一位伟大的公民打算将11月5日永远刻入我们的记忆中，他希望以此提醒世界公平，正义和自由不止是口头说——他们是对未来的展望。所以如果你什么也没看见，任对这个政府所犯下的罪行一无所知，我建议你让这个11月5日平淡的过去，可是如果你见到我之所见，如果你感到我之所感，而你愿意寻我之所寻，请你在一年之后的今晚，和我并肩站到议会大厦的外面，我们将一起给他们留下一个永远不会被忘记的11月5日。
