### Question: 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

### Solutionï¼š
Use dictionary in python to achieve \\(O\(n\)\\) time complexity.

```python
# time complexity: O(n)
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type target: int
    :rtype: List[int]
    """
    d = {};
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if (nums[i] not in d):
            d[target - nums[i]] = i;
        else:
            return [d[nums[i]], i];
```
